*some things that I think would be nice if I added them some time*

- [ ] wait for build on multiple packages in CLI
- [ ] more efficient queries for the web handlers
- [ ] combine DB and broadcast to one "storage" object
- [ ] `serene check` command to compare output of `pacman -Qm`
- [X] on-boarding screen when first using the cli, with config to configure pacman, validate server connection
- [ ] rebuild cleaned when non-clean containers fail
- [ ] purge logs after a certain age
- [ ] create `serene manage purge` command which removes all deps that are no longer needed
- [ ] set packager for build packages
- [X] store logs out side of db because this is a huge performance bottleneck
